general/joddocument - change history

== 0.9.76 == Jun 20, 2012
 * PDF JOD documentation split off into a separate addon. The main
   file (jod.pdf) is relatively stable and almost ten times the size
   of the core JOD addon. It has been removed from the core jod addon
   to reduce download times. (jod.pdf) has been available on the JOD Page 
   
   http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/the-jod-page/
   
   for users to download and copy to the correct (jodhelp) 
   directory but with the proliferation of J platforms and 
   JOD versions this is getting messy. It's easier to use
   JAL to distribute this file and change (jodhelp) to 
   look in this addon's directories.
